              Hello! Iâ€™m a passionate web developer with a love for creating intuitive and engaging user experiences. 
              I specialize in front-end development, working with technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. 
              I also work with backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. 
              My goal is to build websites and applications that are not only functional but also delightful to use.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new web development trends, contributing to open-source projects, and learning new
              technologies that help me grow as a developer.
